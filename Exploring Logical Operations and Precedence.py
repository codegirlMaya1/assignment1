#Task 1: Validating Calculations Calculate the value of a particular arithmetic expression twice: once normally, and once using parentheses. Compare the two results to see if they match.

a=7
b=9

total=a+b
total_2=(a+b)

print(total)
print (total_2)  #same

c=-50

#Task 2: Mix and Match Combine arithmetic (+), logical (or), and comparison (>) operators in a single expression and predict the outcome. Then, compute the expression to see if the prediction was correct.

ball=1
goal=2
team=2
player_score_chance=12
flag=1
 
result = ball + goal  and team + flag or ball + team and flag + goal > + player_score_chance
print (result) #guess 3
